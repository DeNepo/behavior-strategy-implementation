# TDD with LLMs

> This chapter is adapted from [Emerging Talent](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/test-driven-development-with-large-language-models)

Practice integrating LLMs with your TDD workflow to quickly develop outstanding documentation, tests and solutions.

- The [guide video](./guide.mp4) walks you through a suggested workflow you can practice.  The video was recorded with Python, but you don't need to perfectly understand the code to understand the stages of development.
- The [exercises](./exercises) are just one-sentence challenges.  You can start with ours for inspiration, then let your imagination fly!
