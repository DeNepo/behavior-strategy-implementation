## Lesson Plan

> during Sunday class
> - [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/testing/week-1)

Learn about arrays:

- Accessing and modifying entries
- `for ... of` loops

### Isolate

<!-- - Arrays: [examples](../isolate/arrays/examples), [exercises](../isolate/arrays/exercises) -->
- `for ... of`: [examples](../isolate/for-fo/examples), [exercises](../isolate/for-of/exercises)

### Integrate

Build a simple website that stores user input in an array.

The project this week is not collaborative.  You work together in your small groups, but should not be working on the same repository.

- [Week 1 in-class project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/testing-integrate-week-2) (starter repo)

Helpful code to study:

- [User input in an array](../integrate/user-input-in-an-array.html)
- example directories in the project repo
  - `/about-testing`
  - `/example`
