# Behavior, Strategy, Implementation

> Be creative while inventing ideas, but be disciplined while implementing them.
>
> - [Amit Kalantri](https://amitkalantri.com/tag/quotes-about-creativity/)

- Behavior: What does code do? What are it‚Äôs arguments and it‚Äôs return value? How could you use it in a program? Behavior is checked by tests
- Strategy: How could you transform the arguments to the return value in small steps, focusing on the data not the code. This is the realm of flow charts, diagrams, and pseudocode.
- Implementation: Which language features and which lines of code can you use to make your strategy a reality?

## Getting Started

> You will need [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) on your computer to study this material

1. Clone this repository:
   - `git clone git@github.com:HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation.git` (SSH)
   - `git clone https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation.git` (HTTPS)
   - `gh repo clone HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation` (GH CLI)
1. `cd` into the repository
   - `cd behavior-strategy-implementation`

### In the Browser

> Using a browser with good DevTools will make your life easier: [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

1. Install or update the `study-lenses` package globally
   - `npm install -g study-lenses` (if you do not have it already)
   - `npm update -g study-lenses` (if you already have it installed)
2. Run the `study` command from your CLI
   - `study`
3. The material will open in your default browser, you're good to go!

> If you have a windows computer and get this error:
>
> - `... /study.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts ...`
>
> follow the instructions in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63424744), that should take care of it ; )

### In Node.js

> The [debugger built into VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging) is very good, it's all you'll need. Don't forget to set [breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints)!

1. Install the repository's local dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Running files in `.js` (without .test):
   - _debugger_: open the file, select the debug option from your VSCode side-bar, choose the `Current JS File (no tests)` option, and click `|>`.
   - _console_: `node path/to/file.js`, simple and easy
3. Running files ending in `.test.js`:
   - _debugger_: open the file, select the debug option from your VSCode side-bar, choose the `Current JS File (with tests)` option, and click `|>`.
   - _console_: files ending in .test.js must be run with `mocha` -> `mocha path/to/file.test.js`. You will need to globally install mocha for this (`npm install -g mocha`)

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Write lots of good comments, learn more about this in [./studying-javascript](./studying-javascript)
- Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
- Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips

Not all assignments are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible.

- ü•ö `:egg:` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges!

### After Class

> Group Project, [favorite-word](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/favorite-word)

Bring it all together and prepare for the next module with this large project. Practice everything you've learned about JavaScript, problem solving and collaboration. There is no need to improve the UI in this project, you'll get plenty of time for that in the next module. The starter repository comes with these steps completed for you:

- Project Planning
- Repository Structure
- Description and tests for every .js except interactions
- Documentation for the `/src` folder
- A GitHub action to auto-generate docs so they are always up to date with master branch
- First 2 steps of the Dev Strategy

The rest is up to you! Here are some tips:

- Create one label for each folder in `/src`: `interactions`, `logic`, ...
- Create one milestone for each step in the dev-strategy
- Create an issue for each incomplete `.js` file in the `/src` folder
  - label each issue according to which folder the file is in (`interactions`, `logic`, ...)
  - milestone each issue according to it's step in the dev-strategy
  - assign each issue to a team member
- Develop each javascript file on a separate branch
  - create a PR for each branch when it is ready
  - link your PR to this task's issue
  - complete a code review before merging each file to master
- These types of functions can be developed on their own, they do not use other functions:
  - `prompts`, `logic`, `renders`
  - all of these files have tests
- Interactions cannot be developed until the functions they use are ready:
  - your team will need to coordinate!
  - you will need to reverse-engineer these using `index.re.html`

#### Checklist

Use this in your `group-project` issue:

```markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_)
- [ ] [Figma planning document](_)
- [ ] [one issue per .js file](https://github.com/_/_/issues)
