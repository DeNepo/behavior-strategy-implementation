debugger; /*

  open the Global scope in your browser's debugger
  scroll through all of the properties, do some look familiar?

  all these properties come built into the browser environment
  you can (and have!) use them as global variables
  you can use them as plain variables or as window properties

  find the .console.log property, this is what you use for interactions
  the rest of this file will explore changes to this property

  hint: firefox conveniently collapses built-ins under <default properties>
    to make these examples easier to study in other browsers
    all the variable names will start with "a" so you don't have to scroll so much

  you can reassign these to different values!

  reassigning the variable or the window property is the same
