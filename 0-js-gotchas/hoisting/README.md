> The code in this folder is written to study in a browser environment, and the
> study tips are written for the browser's debugger. If you want to study this
> code in another environment here are some tips:
>
> - In _Node.js_ you will need to replace `window` with `global`. The debugger
>   will also be a little different, but for the most part this code will work
>   the same in Node as a browser.
> - _JS Tutor_ is always in strict mode, you can't turn that off. So the
>   examples that use undeclared variables will not work. You will also need to
>   replace `window` with `global`. Overall JS Tutor is not a great environment
>   for studying these examples, it's designed to hide the messy details of JS
>   and that's exactly what this chapter is about
